## 2026-04-21 — Fix `$root` binding collision with `$` path resolution + bindings API for TS

### Bug fix
Passing a `$root` binding (e.g. from Eagle to provide the full unsliced IDM) overwrote the internal scope key that `$` path resolution uses, making `$.field` resolve against the binding instead of the input. Now `$` path resolution uses a separate internal key (`"$"`) that bindings cannot collide with.

After fix:
- `$.field` always resolves from the **input** (first argument to `Execute`/`evaluate`)
- `$root` as an identifier resolves from the **binding** when provided, or defaults to input
- Other bindings (`$source`, `$event`, etc.) work as before

### TS bindings API
`evaluate()` and `execute()` in the TypeScript engine now accept an optional `bindings` parameter, matching the .NET API:
```typescript
execute(script, input, { $root: fullDoc, $source: sourceInfo })
```

### Files
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/ElwoodEngine.cs` — set `"$"` key before bindings loop
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs` — use `"$"` for path resolution, lambda context, join, memo
- `ts/src/evaluator.ts` — mirror all `$root` → `$` changes, accept bindings in evaluateExpression/evaluateScript
- `ts/src/index.ts` — add optional `bindings` parameter to public `evaluate()` and `execute()`
- `ts/tests/conformance.test.ts` — load `bindings.json` when present
- `dotnet/tests/Elwood.Core.Tests/FileBasedTests.cs` — load `bindings.json` when present
- `spec/test-cases/91-root-binding/` — new test: `$root` binding vs `$` input resolution

## 2026-04-20 — Optional chaining (`?.`) + enriched null-access errors

### Optional chaining
New `?.` operator for safe property access on nullable values, matching the pattern established by C#, Kotlin, Swift, and JavaScript:

```elwood
$.variant?.sku             // returns null if variant is null
$.variant.sku              // throws with enriched error if variant is null
```

Combines naturally with `.omitNulls()` for the Eagle map migration pattern:
```elwood
{ name: $.name, sku: $.variant?.sku, size: $.variant?.title }.omitNulls()
```

Works in both path expressions (`$.a?.b`) and member access (`expr?.prop`).

### Enriched null-access errors
When strict access (`.`) hits null, the error now includes:
- Full expression chain: `Expression: $.variant.sku — $.variant is null`
- Pipe iteration context: `While processing item [1] of 3 in | select`
- Fix suggestion: `Did you mean: $.variant?.sku`

### C#/TS consistency
Both engines now throw on strict null path access (previously TS silently returned null). Optional chaining (`?.`) provides the explicit opt-in for safe navigation.

## 2026-04-19 — `.omitNulls()` method

New built-in method that removes null-valued properties from objects. Designed for Eagle map migration where `nullValueHandling: "Ignore"` (the default on 98% of production maps) automatically strips nulls from output.

```elwood
{ name: $.name, email: $.email, phone: $.phone }.omitNulls()
// If phone is null → { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }
```

- Works on objects (returns new object without null properties) and arrays (maps over elements)
- Shallow: only strips top-level null properties, not nested nulls
- Implemented in both .NET and TypeScript engines

## 2026-04-19 — Evaluator fix: property access on arrays + playground enhancements

### Bug fix: misleading "Undefined variable" error

When accessing a non-existent property on an array (e.g., `$.users[*]` where the root is an array of objects with no `users` property), the evaluator produced the misleading error "Undefined variable 'u'" instead of identifying the real issue.

**Root cause:** In `evalPath`, the filter `.filter(v => v !== null)` used strict equality, allowing `undefined` (from missing properties) to pass through as array items. These `undefined` values eventually reached lambda binding, where `scope.get('u')` returned `undefined` — indistinguishable from "variable not declared".

**Fix:**
- Changed filter to `.filter(v => v != null)` (loose equality catches both null and undefined)
- When all items in the array lack the requested property, throw a helpful error with suggestions:
  - **Before:** `Undefined variable 'u'.`
  - **After:** `Property 'users' not found on any item in the Array. Available properties: code, label-en_US`

All 143 existing tests pass (86 conformance + 25 unit + 2 benchmark + 28 lexer + 27 parser - some shared across suites).

### Files modified
- `ts/src/evaluator.ts` — property access on arrays: filter fix + helpful error message

## 2026-04-19 — Playground: large file mode + size display

Ported three features from the Eagle Frontend's Elwood Playground to the standalone playground.

### Large File Mode
- Threshold: 1 MB (`LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD`)
- When input exceeds the threshold, automatically switches the input editor to `plaintext` (disabling syntax highlighting, word wrap, folding, and validation decorations) for performance
- Badge/button in input panel header lets the user toggle: clicking in large file mode shows a confirmation modal warning about potential slowness; clicking in full highlighting mode re-enables large file mode immediately
- State: `largeFileModeOverride` (null = auto-detect, false = user forced full highlighting)

### Input size display
- Formatted file size (B / KB / MB) shown in the input panel header

### Output size display
- Formatted output size shown in the output panel header, next to execution time

### Files
- `playground/src/App.tsx` — large file mode state, threshold, formatSize helper, input/output size in panel headers, editor props for large file mode
- `playground/src/components/LargeFileConfirmModal.tsx` (NEW) — confirmation dialog when disabling large file mode

---

## 2026-04-18 — Playground: server-side share for large files

The share feature previously encoded everything (expression + input + format) into the URL hash using lz-string compression. This produced unusable URLs for large input files (e.g., 50MB JSON).

### Hybrid share approach
- **Small payloads** (compressed URL <= 8000 chars): LZ-string inline in `#data=...` — same as before, no server needed
- **Large payloads** (compressed URL > 8000 chars): uploaded to a Cloudflare Worker + KV, URL becomes `#s=<shortId>`

### Cloudflare Worker (`elwood-share`)
- Deployed at `https://elwood-share.max-favilli.workers.dev`
- `POST /share` — stores `{e, i, f}` in Cloudflare KV, returns `{id}` (8-char random ID)
- `GET /share/:id` — retrieves stored payload
- Max payload: 25 MB, TTL: 90 days, CORS restricted to GitHub Pages origin + localhost

### Files
- `playground/worker/src/index.ts` (NEW) — Cloudflare Worker
- `playground/worker/wrangler.toml` (NEW) — Worker config with KV binding

## 2026-04-18 — Test case 87: groupBy with memo + bracket property access

New conformance test case combining several features in a real-world product image grouping scenario.

### Features tested
1. Bracket property access — `item["label-en_US"]` for hyphenated property names
2. Memoized function — `memo label => ...` caches colorway extraction
3. String split + interpolation — splits on `_`, recombines via template string
4. groupBy with computed key — groups items by extracted colorway
5. Nested select — `g.items | select i => i.external_url` inside outer select

## 2026-04-09 — Phase 3 Step 6c: AsyncExecutor

Step-at-a-time executor for `mode: async` pipelines, designed for queue-triggered Functions where each invocation is short-lived.

### What's new
- **`AsyncExecutor`** — `StartAsync` creates state + stores payload/pipeline in IDocumentStore + queues stage 0 sources. `ExecuteStepAsync` processes one source or output per invocation, advances the pipeline when stage/execution completes.
- **`IStepQueue`** interface + `InMemoryStepQueue` for tests. Service Bus impl ships in 6d.
- **`StepMessage`** — ExecutionId, PipelineId, StepType (Source/Output), StepName, StageIndex
- **Fan-in via idempotent steps** — after completing a source, checks all sources in stage. If multiple workers see "all done" and queue the next stage, the duplicate messages are caught by the idempotency check (completed steps are no-ops). Standard at-least-once pattern.
- **8 tests** — start + state, source processing, output completion, multi-stage ordering, concurrent sources queued together, idempotent duplicate handling, failed source halts pipeline, end-to-end drive-the-queue loop

### Design decisions
- **Stateless workers:** pipeline content, trigger payload, IDM, and stage plan are ALL stored in IDocumentStore. Queue workers load everything from storage — no local git clone, no in-memory state between invocations.
- **No atomic counters:** fan-in uses state-based checking + idempotency instead of Redis HINCRBY counters. Simpler, no IStateStore interface changes. At-most-one-extra duplicate message per stage transition.
- **Shared helpers with SyncExecutor:** MergeIntoIdm, EvaluateReference, SerializeValue, DeliverToDestinations are duplicated (not extracted to a shared class) to keep each executor self-contained. Can refactor later if needed.

### Files
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Pipeline/Async/AsyncExecutor.cs` (NEW)
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Pipeline/Async/IStepQueue.cs` (NEW)
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Pipeline/Async/InMemoryStepQueue.cs` (NEW)
- `dotnet/tests/Elwood.Pipeline.Tests/AsyncExecutorTests.cs` (NEW — 8 tests)
- `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/changelog.md`

## 2026-04-09 — Phase 3 Step 6b: GitPipelineStore

Git-backed pipeline store. Every save is a git commit, revision history comes from `git log`, restore checks out files at a previous revision and commits the result.

### What's new
- **`GitPipelineStore`** — implements `IPipelineStore`, wraps `FileSystemPipelineStore` for file I/O and adds git operations via `GitHelper`
- **`GitHelper`** — thin wrapper around the git CLI. Uses `Process.Start("git", ...)` rather than LibGit2Sharp to avoid native binary compatibility issues on newer .NET versions. The same approach used by Azure DevOps Pipelines, GitHub Actions, and Terraform.
- **11 tests** exercising: save/get round-trip, list with filter, delete + commit, revision history ordering + limits, restore to older revision (including script add/removal), author recording in commits, invalid revision handling, empty repo safety

### Design decisions
- **Git CLI over LibGit2Sharp:** LibGit2Sharp has chronic native binary issues on .NET 8+/10+ and arm64. The git CLI is always available on servers and CI runners.
- **Store doesn't manage remotes/push/pull:** The API server (6e) handles webhook-triggered `git pull` and optional `git push`. The store is concerned only with local commits.
- **Wraps FileSystemPipelineStore:** Read operations (List, Get) are delegated directly. Write operations (Save, Delete) write files via the FS store, then stage + commit.

### Files modified
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Pipeline/Registry/GitPipelineStore.cs` (NEW)
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Pipeline/Registry/GitHelper.cs` (NEW)
- `dotnet/tests/Elwood.Pipeline.Tests/GitPipelineStoreTests.cs` (NEW — 11 tests)
- `docs/roadmap.md` (mark Step 6b complete)
- `docs/changelog.md`

## 2026-04-08 — Phase 3 Step 6a: pipeline modes + Azure storage adapters (v0.4.0)

First slice of Phase 3 Step 6 (Cloud Executors). Lays the foundation for production cloud deployment by adding:

1. **Pipeline mode + response output** in the YAML schema, validated at parse time.
2. **`Elwood.Pipeline.Azure`** opt-in NuGet package with Redis state, Blob document, and Redis registry adapters.
3. **24 integration tests** using Testcontainers (real Redis + Azurite).
4. **CI fix:** the existing `ci.yml` was only running `Elwood.Core.Tests`. Now runs all 6 .NET test projects (Core, Pipeline, CLI, Parquet, Pipeline.Azure) on every push.

### Schema additions

```yaml
mode: sync                       # default — runs in HTTP function lifetime, returns one output to caller
                                 # OR mode: async — fans out via queue, returns 202 + execution ID

outputs:
  - name: api-response
    response: true               # required exactly once when mode is sync, forbidden when async
    map: build-response.elwood
  - name: log-to-blob
    destinations:
      blob:
        - container: audit-log   # side effect — not returned
```

Validation rules (enforced by `PipelineParser.ValidateConfig`):
- `mode` must be "sync" or "async" (case-insensitive)
- Sync mode requires exactly one output with `response: true`
- Async mode forbids `response: true` on any output
- Default mode is "sync" if omitted

Two helper properties on `PipelineConfig`: `IsSyncMode` and `ResponseOutput`.

### Storage adapters (`Elwood.Pipeline.Azure`)

| Adapter | Backs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RedisStateStore` | `IStateStore` | Per-step updates use Lua scripts for atomic load → mutate → save with `KEEPTTL`. Default TTL: 3 days. Concurrent fan-out workers can update the same execution without lost updates. |
| `BlobDocumentStore` | `IDocumentStore` | Blob name = document key. Container auto-created. 404 → null. Lifecycle delegated to Azure Blob lifecycle policies. |
| `RedisPipelineRegistry` | `IPipelineRegistry` | Two constructors: read-only for executors, writable for the API server. Literal route matching only in 6a (parameter extraction deferred to 6d). |

DI helpers: `AddElwoodAzureStorage(opts => ...)` + `AddElwoodAzureWritablePipelineRegistry(...)`.

### Test strategy (no local Docker required)

- **Unit tier** runs everywhere — `dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration"` builds the new project but skips its tests
- **Integration tier** runs on CI (`ubuntu-latest` has Docker pre-installed) and locally if you have Docker
- All `Elwood.Pipeline.Azure.Tests` are marked `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]`
- The concurrent-writers test (`UpdateSourceStep_ConcurrentWriters_NoLostUpdates`) fires 20 parallel updates against the same execution and asserts all 20 sources persist — proves Lua atomicity. Will fail loudly if anyone "simplifies" to read-modify-write.
- The `KEEPTTL` test verifies the Lua script preserves the original expiration across updates.

### Versions bumped to 0.4.0

| Package | 0.3.0 → 0.4.0 |
|---|---|
| `Elwood.Core` | ✓ |
| `Elwood.Json` | ✓ |
| `Elwood.Pipeline` | ✓ |
| `Elwood.Cli` | ✓ |
| `Elwood.Xlsx` | ✓ |
| `Elwood.Parquet` | ✓ |
| `Elwood.Pipeline.Azure` | new — first publish at 0.4.0 |
| `@elwood-lang/core` | ✓ |
| `@elwood-lang/xlsx` | ✓ |

### CI/release workflow changes

- `ci.yml`: build step unchanged, test step now runs the entire solution (`dotnet test dotnet/Elwood.slnx`) instead of only `Elwood.Core.Tests`. **Pre-existing gap** — Pipeline, CLI, Parquet test projects were never run on CI before this change. They are now.
- `release.yml`: pack/push commands extended with `Elwood.Pipeline.Azure`. Same `--skip-duplicate` pattern as the rest.

## 2026-04-07 — v0.3.0 npm follow-up

The first `v0.3.0` workflow run shipped all six NuGet packages successfully but the npm publish job failed because `ts/package.json` was still at `0.2.0` (already on npm). This follow-up bumps the npm packages and adds `@elwood-lang/xlsx` to the workflow alongside `@elwood-lang/core`.

### Published to npm
- `@elwood-lang/core` 0.3.0
- `@elwood-lang/xlsx` 0.3.0 (newly added to workflow — was never auto-published before)

### Not published — `@elwood-lang/parquet`
The npm Parquet extension cannot ship in its current form. The only mature JS Parquet reader (`hyparquet`) is async-only, but Elwood's TS extension API in `ts/src/extensions.ts` is synchronous. Use `Elwood.Parquet` (.NET) for Parquet I/O. Tracked in `docs/known-issues.md`.

### Release workflow fixes
- Move `NPM_TOKEN` env to job level (same fix pattern as `NUGET_API_KEY`)
- Add `@elwood-lang/xlsx` install/build/publish steps
- Comment in workflow explains why `ts-parquet` is excluded

### Files modified
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `ts/package.json`
- `ts/package-lock.json`
- `ts-xlsx/package.json`

- `docs/changelog.md`

## 2026-04-07 — v0.3.0 NuGet release (Phase 1c complete)

All Elwood packages published to nuget.org. Closes the last open item in Phase 1c (publishing was previously blocked on a locked NuGet account).

### Packages published

| Package | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Elwood.Core` | 0.3.0 | Engine, multi-target net8.0;net10.0 |
| `Elwood.Json` | 0.3.0 | System.Text.Json adapter |
| `Elwood.Pipeline` | 0.3.0 | Pipeline YAML parser + executor (new) |
| `Elwood.Cli` | 0.3.0 | `dotnet tool install --global Elwood.Cli` |
| `Elwood.Xlsx` | 0.3.0 | XLSX format extension |
| `Elwood.Parquet` | 0.3.0 | Parquet format extension |

### Release workflow fixes
- Moved `NUGET_API_KEY` env to job level so the `if:` guard on the push step works correctly
- Added pack/push commands for `Elwood.Pipeline`, `Elwood.Xlsx`, `Elwood.Parquet` (previously the workflow only published Core/Json/Cli)
- Pipeline is packed and pushed before Cli so the dotnet tool can resolve its dependency

### Files modified
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Elwood.Core.csproj`
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Json/Elwood.Json.csproj`

## 2026-03-24 — Performance benchmarks (Phase 2b complete)

Benchmarked Elwood against a legacy JSONPath-based transformation engine on 100K rows (fair in-process comparison):

| Test | Elwood .NET | Legacy baseline | Elwood TS |
|---|---|---|---|
| where+select name | 121ms | 240ms | 24ms |
| toString + charArray concat | 836ms | 1,819ms | 173ms |

- .NET interpreter is **2x faster** than legacy baseline thanks to lazy evaluation via `LazyArrayValue`
- TypeScript interpreter is **~5x faster than .NET** — V8's JIT aggressively optimizes native array methods
- Expression Tree compilation was explored but removed — the interpreter's lazy streaming outperforms compiled fused loops
- CLI integration tests added (15 tests)

## 2026-03-24 — Parquet extension + binary pass-through (full format parity)

All common data integration content types are now supported in Elwood.

- **`Elwood.Parquet`** (.NET) — fromParquet/toParquet using Parquet.Net, all types + compression
- **`@elwood-lang/parquet`** (npm) — fromParquet (read-only) using hyparquet
- CLI `--input-format binary` reads files as base64 (auto-detects .pdf, .png, .parquet, etc.)

## 2026-03-23 — CLI format flags (Phase 2 complete)

Added `--input-format` and `--output-format` flags to the CLI, completing Phase 2.

- `--input-format csv|txt|xml` — override input format (auto-detected from file extension by default)
- `--output-format csv|txt|xml` — convert output to the specified format
- `-if` / `-of` short forms
- REPL `:load` auto-detects format from file extension
- Stdin piping respects `--input-format`

### Examples
```bash
elwood run transform.elwood --input data.csv
elwood eval "$.fromCsv() | select r => r.name" --input data.csv --output-format csv
cat data.xml | elwood eval "$.fromXml().orders" --input-format xml
```

### Files modified
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Cli/Program.cs` — full rewrite of input/output handling

## 2026-03-23 — Extension API + XLSX support

Added a plugin/extension system that allows optional packages to register custom methods, and used it to implement XLSX (Excel) support as the first extension.

### Extension API
- **.NET**: `ElwoodEngine.RegisterMethod(name, handler)` — extensions provide `ElwoodMethodHandler` delegates
- **TypeScript**: `registerMethod(name, handler)` — global registry, extensions auto-register on import
- Extensions cannot override built-in methods — the built-in switch runs first

### XLSX Extension
- **`Elwood.Xlsx`** (.NET) — NuGet package using `DocumentFormat.OpenXml`
- **`@elwood-lang/xlsx`** (npm) — package using SheetJS (`xlsx`)

## 2026-03-22 — Bracket property access

Added `obj["propertyName"]` syntax for accessing properties with special characters (e.g., `@`-prefixed XML attributes).

- `b["@id"]` — access XML attribute properties from `fromXml()` output
- `obj[variable]` — dynamic property access with computed keys
- Works in both .NET and TypeScript evaluators

### Test cases added
- `86-bracket-property-access` — XML attributes accessed via bracket notation

### Files modified
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs` — EvaluateIndex: string index on objects
- `ts/src/evaluator.ts` — evalIndex: string index on objects
- `docs/syntax-reference.md` — bracket property access syntax

## 2026-03-22 — fromXml / toXml (Phase 2)

Added XML format conversion — the last built-in format I/O pair.

### New features
- `.fromXml(options?)` — parse XML string into navigable JSON structure
  - Attributes → `@attr` properties, repeated elements → arrays, leaf elements → strings
  - Options: `attributePrefix` (default `@`), `stripNamespaces` (default `true`)
- `.toXml(options?)` — serialize JSON object to XML string
  - Single top-level key becomes root element; arrays become repeated elements
  - Options: `attributePrefix`, `rootElement`, `declaration` (default `true`)

### Test cases added
- `83-fromxml` — parse XML with repeated elements, pipe through select
- `84-toxml` — serialize JSON with arrays to XML
- `85-fromxml-file` — real XML file as input, filter + transform pipeline

### Files modified
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs` — EvaluateFromXml, EvaluateToXml, XML helper methods
- `ts/src/evaluator.ts` — parseXml (zero-dependency XML parser), evalFromXml, evalToXml, XML helpers
- `docs/syntax-reference.md` — added fromXml/toXml

## 2026-03-22 — parseJson and CSV enhancements (Phase 2)

Added `.parseJson()` method for deserializing embedded JSON strings, and enhanced `fromCsv`/`toCsv` with additional options.

### New features
- `.parseJson()` — general-purpose method to deserialize a JSON string into a navigable value; returns null if invalid
- `fromCsv({ parseJson: true })` — automatically detect and parse JSON values in CSV cells
- `fromCsv({ skipRows: n })` — skip leading metadata/title rows before parsing
- `fromCsv({ headers: false })` — auto-generates alphabetic column names (A, B, C, ... Z, AA, AB) matching Excel convention
- `toCsv({ alwaysQuote: true })` — forces all fields to be quoted, useful for strict RFC 4180 compliance

### Test framework
- Test runners now support `input.csv`, `input.txt`, `input.xml` as alternatives to `input.json`
- Non-JSON input files are read as raw strings ($ = file content), enabling `$.fromCsv()` directly
- Parser fix: `$.method()` now correctly resolves as a method call when `$` is a string value (DollarDot token consumed the dot that ParsePostfix needed)

### Test cases added
- `77-fromcsv-no-headers` — skipRows + auto-generated column names
- `78-tocsv-always-quote` — alwaysQuote option
- `79-parsejson` — standalone parseJson method with navigation and null fallback
- `80-fromcsv-parsejson` — fromCsv with parseJson option for embedded JSON in cells
- `81-fromcsv-file` — real CSV file as input (input.csv instead of input.json)
- `82-fromtext-file` — real text file as input (input.txt, log filtering example)

### Files modified
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs` — EvaluateParseJson, EvaluateFromCsv (skipRows, auto columns, parseJson), EvaluateToCsv (alwaysQuote), CsvEscape, GetAlphabeticColumnName
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Parsing/Parser.cs` — ParsePath: detect method call on last path segment
- `dotnet/tests/Elwood.Core.Tests/FileBasedTests.cs` — support input.csv/txt/xml, string input handling
- `ts/src/evaluator.ts` — parseJson case, evalFromCsv (skipRows, auto columns, parseJson), evalToCsv (alwaysQuote), csvEscape, getAlphabeticColumnName, getOptNumber helper
- `ts/src/parser.ts` — parsePath: detect method call on last path segment
- `ts/tests/conformance.test.ts` — support input.csv/txt/xml, string input handling
- `docs/syntax-reference.md` — added parseJson, updated fromCsv/toCsv option lists

## 2026-03-22 — iterate and takeWhile

Added `iterate(seed, fn)` for generating lazy sequences and `takeWhile` pipe operator for conditional sequence limiting.

### New features
- `iterate(seed, fn)` — generates a lazy sequence: `[seed, fn(seed), fn(fn(seed)), ...]`. Must be limited by `take`, `takeWhile`, or `first`.
- `| takeWhile predicate` — takes items while predicate is true, then short-circuits. Critical for infinite sequences.
- Safety limit: iterate throws after 1,000,000 iterations (.NET) / 10,000 (TypeScript) without a limiting operator.

### Test cases added
- `69-iterate-basic` — powers of 2 with take
- `70-iterate-state` — accumulating state across iterations
- `71-takewhile` — conditional limit on infinite sequence
- `72-iterate-fibonacci` — Fibonacci sequence via iterate

### Files modified
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Syntax/Ast.cs` — TakeWhileOperation
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Parsing/Parser.cs` — takeWhile parser
- `dotnet/src/Elwood.Core/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs` — takeWhile + iterate evaluation
- `ts/src/ast.ts`, `ts/src/parser.ts`, `ts/src/evaluator.ts` — TypeScript ports
- `docs/syntax-reference.md` — takeWhile + iterate documented

## 2026-03-21 — Comprehensive function library, file-based tests, full function parity, join modes

Massive expansion of built-in functions, covering all common JSON transformation operations. Added file-based test framework with 63+ test cases (each with input, expression, expected output, and explanation).

### New pipe operators
- `| concat` / `| concat separator` — join array into string (default separator `|`)
- `| index` — replace items with 0-based indices
- `| reduce (acc, x) => expr [from init]` — general-purpose fold
- `| join source on lKey equals rKey [into alias]` — hash-join two arrays (O(n+m))
- `| first pred` / `| last pred` — optional predicate for first/last matching item

### New built-in methods
- **String**: `left(n)`, `right(n)`, `padLeft(w, c)`, `padRight(w, c)`, `toCharArray()`, `regex(pattern)`, `urlDecode()`, `urlEncode()`, `sanitize()`, `concat(sep, ...arrays)`
- **String extended**: `toLower(position)`, `toUpper(position)`, `trim(chars)`, `trimStart(chars)`, `trimEnd(chars)`, `replace(s, r, caseInsensitive)`
- **Numeric**: `truncate()`, `round("awayFromZero"|"toEven")`
- **DateTime**: `dateFormat(fmt)`, `dateFormat(inputFmt, outputFmt)`, `tryDateFormat(...)`, `add(timespan)`, `toUnixTimeSeconds()`, `now(fmt, timezone)`, `utcNow(fmt)`
- **Type conversion**: `convertTo("Int32"|"Double"|"Boolean"|...)`, `boolean()`, `not()`, `toString(format)`
- **Null/empty checks**: `isNull()`, `isEmpty()`, `isNullOrEmpty()`, `isNullOrWhiteSpace()` — all with optional fallback argument
- **Object manipulation**: `clone()`, `keep(props...)`, `remove(props...)`, `in(arrays...)`
- **Collection**: `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, `first()`, `last()`, `take(n)`, `skip(n)`, `index()`
- **Crypto**: `hash(length?)`, `rsaSign(data, key)`
- **Generators**: `range(start, count)`, `newGuid()`

### New language features
- **Spread operator**: `{ ...obj, newProp: val }` — copy object properties
- **Memo functions**: `let f = memo x => expr` — memoized functions with automatic cache by argument
- **Array slice**: `$[2:5]`, `$[:3]`, `$[-2:]` — native JSONPath slice syntax
- **Auto-mapping**: `$.items[*].name` maps property access over arrays
- **Method calls on paths**: `$.items[*].length()` — parser correctly handles `.method()` after path expressions
- **String comparison**: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` work on strings (ordinal comparison)

### Test framework
- File-based test framework: triplets of `.elwood` + `.input.json` + `.expected.json` + `.explanation.md`
- 63 file-based test cases covering all features
- 25 code-based tests (including non-deterministic functions)
- 88 total tests passing
